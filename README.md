# Machine Learning (Linear Regression)

## This project involves the implementation of a Predictive Machine Learning Model in Python using popular libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit-learn. The model focuses on predicting house prices and its accuracy and generalization ability were evaluated through hyperparameter tuning and data visualization techniques.

• Knowledge of Python programming for data handling and information processing.

• Use of popular Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit-learn for data analysis and manipulation.

• Knowledge of statistics to understand and analyze data.

• Data preprocessing, including cleaning, normalization, and selection of relevant features.

• Implementation and training of the machine learning model (in this case, a linear regression model) to predict house prices.

• Evaluation of the model to measure its accuracy and generalization ability.

• Selection of model hyperparameters to improve its performance.

• Use of graphics and visualizations to interpret data and model results.

• Integration of different techniques and approaches to create a high-quality and accurate model.
